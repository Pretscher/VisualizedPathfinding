# VisualizedPathfinding
A project that will focus on creating an (internally) multithreaded A*-Pathfinding Algorithm on binary heaps. 
Goal for the Visualization is choosing a start and goal for the path with your mouse and then having different options:
1) Show (step by step) every node that is considered by the algorithm (pushed into the binary heap) and mark each node that
the algorithm chooses for the path
2) Run the Algorithm as fast as possible and just mark the path found and the considered nodes in the end.
3) If I am very motivated: do 1) with many different Algorithms so that you can compare them.
